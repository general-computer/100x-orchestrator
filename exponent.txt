100x-orchestrator: AI Agent Orchestration System

Overview:
A sophisticated orchestration system that manages multiple AI coding agents working on software development tasks. The system uses Aider (an AI coding assistant) to handle coding tasks and provides a real-time web interface for monitoring and managing these agents.

Key Components:

1. Orchestrator (orchestrator.py)
- Manages multiple AI coding agents with real-time status tracking
- Handles workspace creation and git repository cloning
- Monitors agent progress with health checks and error handling
- Maintains agent sessions and outputs with WebSocket updates
- Uses Aider for code generation and modifications
- Implements sophisticated error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Provides detailed agent diagnostics and critiques

2. Configuration Manager (config.py)
- Handles system configuration and environment setup
- Manages repository URLs and task tracking
- Controls agent count per task
- Persists configuration in JSON format
- Normalizes file paths across different operating systems

3. Web Interface (app.py)
- Flask-based web application with real-time updates via WebSocket
- Provides comprehensive agent creation and management
- Displays detailed agent status and progress in real-time
- Allows task assignment and monitoring
- Supports agent deletion and cleanup
- Features keyboard shortcuts and toast notifications
- Includes debug endpoints for troubleshooting

Key Features:
- Multi-agent task handling with isolated workspaces
- Git integration with automatic branch management
- Real-time progress monitoring via WebSocket
- Workspace isolation for concurrent agent operations
- Configuration management with JSON persistence
- Web-based control interface with real-time updates
- Automated code critiquing and health monitoring
- Session management with error recovery
- Detailed diagnostic information and debugging tools
- Toast notifications for important events
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
